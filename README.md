# Single Linked List, What Is It?
Single linked list or so-called linked list consists of individual elements, which each connected to a single pointer. Each element consists of two parts, the data/information stored and the pointer section called pointer *next*. By using the two-member structure like this, linked list formed by next pointer from one element to follow. Next to the last pointer is NULL, which indicates the end of a list. The element at the beginning of a list called the *head*, and the last element of a list called the *tail*.
